### Hello there üåä
<p>I'm an aspiring game developer and I'm passionate about creating the best possible experiences that I can. Currently, I specialize in Unity game development, but I am looking to try Unreal Engine when the need arises.</p>

I'm open to collaborate on new game development projects, so feel free to contact me and we can discuss further.

## ‚≠ê Quick Overview
- üéì Bachelor of Science (B.S.), Computer Science
- üßê Interested in Game & Simulation Development, User Interface Design, and Game Artificial Intelligence

## ‚õèÔ∏è Technologies & Tools
These are some of the technologies and tools that I have worked with:
- Languages: C#, C++, Lua, Java, Python, SQL
- Engines/SDKs: Unity, Solar2D
- Other Skills: Leadership, Project Management, Proofreading, Technical Writing

## üöÄ Projects
<p>Here are a few of my published projects:</p>

### 1. [XR Training Simulation for Teacher Education](https://dunnatello.github.io/XRSimulation)
<p><i>XR Training Simulation for Teacher Education</i> is a classroom de-escalation training simulation software designed by myself and my other group members for our senior capstone project. This project features advanced animation systems and complex narrative design.</p>

### 2. [Asteroid Crashers](https://github.com/Dunnatello/AsteroidCrashers/)
<p><i>Asteroid Crashers</i> is a game designed by myself along with my other group members for our Secure Software Engineering university course. This project demonstrates how an anti-cheat system can be implemented into a Unity game.</p>

### 3. [Visions](https://github.com/Dunnatello-DifferentFusion/Visions)
<p><i>Visions</i> is a game designed by myself and my friend for our Advanced Game & Simulation Development course. This project demonstrates ballistic weapon physics in a endless zombie shooter Unity game.</p>

### 4. [Burn it Up!](https://github.com/Dunnatello/BurnItUp)
<p><i>Burn it Up!</i> is a weight loss app designed by myself along with my other group members for our Software Engineering Principles course project. In this project, we implemented a weight loss application in Solar2D/Lua.</p>
